* test on different os
* support vim.tiny in ubuntu (probably won't fix, because vim.tiny doesn't work with my vimrc)
* add option to update.sh for updating submodules ( `.linux_home_config/install.sh` will do the job, however it will remove your vim undo history and backups)
* add .selected_editor, firefox config, .sudo_as_admin_successful
* add note that informs user about config files will be overridden
* add support for opensuse zypper
